# NatalWeatherPrediction

This project aims to predict the weather for the city of Natal, RN using techniques of artificial inteligence (Artificial Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic). The idea was to use data of the weather of Natal from the last 30 years in order to find some  correlation between the weather of the next day from the weather of the two previous days.

The projet is a web application, and was developed in Python with Django, scikit-fuzzy and scikit-learn.
